# Hello World! 2

This is my first blog post using Markdown in Nuxt 3. It's really easy to use Markdown to write content for your website. You can use headings, paragraphs, lists, and other formatting options.

## Subheading

You can also add images and links to your content. For example, here's a picture of a cat:

![Cat](/img/cat.jpg)

And here's a link to the Nuxt 3 documentation:
